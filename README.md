Indian Start Up Funding for 2018 - 2021 Data Analysis

This repository documents the process of analyzing funding received by Indian start-ups from 2018 to 2021. 
Dataset is taken from Kaggle : "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/omkargowda/indian-startups-funding-data"
The project uses exploratory data analysis techniques, such as univariate analysis, bivariate analysis, and correlation analysis, to draw insights on funding received by Indian start-ups and to obtain a descriptive overview and a relationship pattern of funding and growth of newly launched start-ups. 
The analysis is done using the Python programming language and the Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Forexpython libraries in the Jupyter Notebook environment.
The steps involved in the process include installing the necessary libraries and packages, loading the dataset, gaining insight on the data, addressing issues with the data, and establishing the purpose of the analysis.
